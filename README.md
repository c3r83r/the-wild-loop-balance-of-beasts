# The Wild Loop: Balance of Beasts

A dynamic and visual simulation of predator-prey interactions inspired by natural ecosystems. This project explores the cyclical balance between two species — predators and prey — through population self-regulation, randomness, and environmental constraints.

## 🌿 Concept

In nature, when the prey population decreases, predators face starvation and begin to die off. As predators decline, prey populations have a chance to recover, leading to more food for predators, which allows them to grow again — and the cycle continues. This simulation brings that natural phenomenon to life.

## 🦊 Features

- Visual animation of two competing groups: **Predators** and **Prey**
- Simple ecosystem logic with configurable rules
- Real-time population graphs and statistics
- Customizable speed, lifespan, and reproduction rate
- Interactive: pause, reset, and modify environment settings
- Fun, educational, and great for illustrating ecological balance
